        At 3skici, we believe that small actions can lead to big changes. Our platform was founded with sustainability at its core, driven by the urgent need to address the environmental challenges posed by modern consumerism. By fostering a culture of reuse, we aim to reduce waste, conserve resources, and inspire eco-conscious decision-making.

        Why Sustainability Matters
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
        Modern consumerism has led to an alarming increase in waste, overproduction, and resource depletion. These issues contribute to environmental degradation, climate change, and the exhaustion of natural resources. At 3skici, we recognize the role that second-hand commerce can play in combating these problems.
